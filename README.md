## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Intelligent Game Logic
\- Implements **perfect grid-checking logic** for all winning scenarios (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).  
\- Accurately identifies **draws** and declares them when the board is full without a winner.

### 🧍‍♂️ vs 🖥️ User vs Computer
\- Play against a computer that selects random but valid columns.  
\- Ensures no overwriting of filled columns, keeping gameplay error-free.

### 🎭 Symbol Selection
\- Choose whether you want to be **🟡 or 🔴**.  
\- The computer automatically takes the remaining symbol.  
\- Input validation ensures only valid choices are accepted.

### 🔄 First Move Randomizer
\- Fairly choose between the user and the computer to make the **first move**.  
\- Adds unpredictability and variation to every game.

### 🗺️ Visual Game Board
\- Displays a neatly formatted (**6x7 board**) with column headers.  
\- Updated after every move with clear visual structure and emoji symbols.

### 📈 Score Tracker
\- Tracks:  
    \- 🟢 Games Played  
    \- 🏆 Wins  
    \- ❌ Losses  
    \- 🤝 Draws  
\- Print out **cumulative results** after quitting the game.

### ♻️ Replay System
\- After each game, the user is asked if they want to **play again** (`y/n`).  
\- If yes, the game **fully resets** the board and randomly re-selects the first player.  
\- Smooth replay flow, no duplicated printing or stuck loops.

### ✅ Fully Validated Input
\- Handles invalid numeric inputs like letters or symbols with **graceful messages**.  
\- Prevents crashing by checking `Scanner` inputs carefully.  
\- Ensures all moves are within bounds and in empty columns.

### 💤 Realism with Delays
\- Adds **brief delays** before the computer moves, giving a more natural "thinking" effect.

Welcome to Connect Four!

Players take turns dropping their colored discs into one of the columns.
